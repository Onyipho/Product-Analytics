# Product-Analytics
In this project, we carried several analyses of the retail items using the online retail dataset from UCL repository. Analysis includes sales, customer, product, and revenue analysis. We also computed Customer Lifetime Value(CLV). Next, we calculated the churn rate of customers. The analysis provides insight from the retail transactions for better decision making, such as making personalized recommendations of customer retention resulting to profit maximization.
