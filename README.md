# Product-Analytics
In this project, we carried several analysis of the retail items using the online retail dataset from UCL repository. Analysis includes
Sales,customer,product and revenue Analysis. We also computed Customer Life Time Value(CLV).
Next, we calculated the churnrate of custmers.
These analysis are use to gain insight from the retail transactions for better decision making.
